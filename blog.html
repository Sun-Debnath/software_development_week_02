          REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for designing networked applications. A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is an API that follows the principles of REST. It is an interface that allows different systems to communicate over HTTP.

        RESTful APIs are widely used for web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. They have become the standard for building APIs that can be consumed by various clients such as web browsers, mobile applications, and other software systems.
